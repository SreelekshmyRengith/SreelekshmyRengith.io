                <p>
                    I am a dedicated Software Quality Assurance Engineer Intern at the Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Lab, 
                    with a strong background in automated testing, ETL processes, and data validation. 
                    I have experience streamlining testing workflows using Python and Cypress, which has led to increased data accuracy, 
                    reduced testing time, and faster release cycles. Previously, I worked at Infosys, where I optimized ETL data warehouse testing, 
                    improved testing efficiency, and managed successful data migrations across multiple projects. 
                    My proactive approach, collaboration skills, and keen attention to detail drive my passion for delivering reliable,
                    high-quality software solutions.
